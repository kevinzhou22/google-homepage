This project entails building the design of the Google homepage using the basic HTML / CSS skills I've learned. It will not have any functionality.

Completing this project, I've demonstrated a basic ability to set up a webpage using HTML and basic styling capabilities with CSS. In particular, for HTML, I've been able to set up a basic form, a navigation bar, and a footer. For CSS, I've shown that I can position elements on a page (especially with Flexbox) and that I can modify the basic designs / sizes of various elements.
